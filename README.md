# Introduction

The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project is a comprehensive examination of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the wake of this unprecedented global crisis, our project seeks to shed light on the pandemic's spread, effects, and the data-driven insights that can help in understanding and mitigating its impact.

# Objective

This project aims to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data. The project includes a Jupyter notebook with Python code to extract, clean, and visualize COVID-19 data from various sources. Additionally, the project provides a dashboard to explore the data interactively.
 
# ðŸ“ˆCOVID-19_ANALYSIS - ðŸ“‘Brief Summary
</h1>
- Used Pandas and Json to gather data from API and then data cleaning.
<br>
- For K.P.I.â€™s and insights Used SQL to get useful data sets.
<br>
- Then transferred datasets to Excel for visualization.
<br>
- For the presentation used M.S. PowerPoint with the help of team members.

  ðŸ”¡Data Extraction & Cleaning
 <br>
 <br>
1. Import the data from API using the requests library.
<br>
2. The imported data was in JSON format hence we used JSON library to read the data.

3. We looked for null values and replaced them with zero, looking for duplicates.
<br>
4. Stated analyzing the data by using pandas functions like group by, sort_values, etc.
<br>
<br>
5. Used nested 'for' loops to extract the relevant data from the nested dictionary.

6. Extracted the individual state data from the data frame in CSV format and imported data into MySQL.
<br>
7. Aggregated the distribution by month and week wise for each state.
<br>
<br>
8. Imported the aggregated data into Excel for further Analysis.
